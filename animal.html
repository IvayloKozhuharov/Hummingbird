  <h1>The Hummingbird</h1><br>
  <h2>Evolution</h2>
  <p><b>Hummingbirds</b> are <u>birds</u> from the Americas that constitute the <u>family</u> <b>Trochilidae</b>. They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length. Indeed, the smallest <u>extant</u> bird species is a hummingbird, the 5 cm (2.0 in) <u>bee hummingbird</u> weighing less than 2.5 g (0.09 oz).

  They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating <u>wings</u> which flap at high frequencies audible to <u>humans</u>. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, typically around 50 times per second, allowing them also to fly at speeds exceeding 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph).[1][2]

  Hummingbirds have the highest <u>metabolism</u> of any <u>homeothermic</u> animal.[3] To conserve energy when food is scarce, and nightly when not foraging, they go into <u>torpor</u>, a state similar to <u>hibernation</u>, slowing <u>metabolic rate</u> to 1/15th of its normal rate.[4]</p>
