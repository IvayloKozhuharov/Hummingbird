<h1>The Hummingbird</h1><br>
<h2>Evolution</h2>
<p><b>Hummingbirds</b> are <u>birds</u> from the Americas that constitute the <u>family</u> <b>Trochilidae</b>. They are among the smallest of birds, most species measuring 7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length. Indeed, the smallest <u>extant</u> bird species is a hummingbird, the 5 cm (2.0 in) <u>bee hummingbird</u> weighing less than 2.5 g (0.09 oz).

They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings which flap at high frequencies audible to humans. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, typically around 50 times per second, allowing them also to fly at speeds exceeding 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph).[1][2]

Hummingbirds have the highest metabolism of any homeothermic animal.[3] To conserve energy when food is scarce, and nightly when not foraging, they go into torpor, a state similar to hibernation, slowing metabolic rate to 1/15th of its normal rate.[4]</p>
